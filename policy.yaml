      # It's a bit clunky, but this so we can use lib.result_helper.
      # If we do it like this it fetches every time which is slow:
      - github.com/conforma/policy//policy/lib
      # ...so for speed you could use a nearby checked out repo:
      #- ../policy/policy/lib

      # The location of the policies here in this repo
      - ./policy
